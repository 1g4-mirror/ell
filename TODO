Background
==========

- Priority scale: High, Medium and Low

- Complexity scale: C1, C2, C4 and C8.  The complexity scale is exponential,
  with complexity 1 being the lowest complexity.  Complexity is a function
  of both task 'complexity' and task 'scope'.

  The general rule of thumb is that a complexity 1 task should take 1-2 weeks
  for a person very familiar with the codebase.  Higher complexity tasks
  require more time and have higher uncertainty.

  Higher complexity tasks should be refined into several lower complexity tasks
  once the task is better understood.


DBus API
========

- Add APIs that would allow an application to listen to a particular signal or
  set of signals.  The set of signals can be specified by using signal filtering
  mechanisms specified in the DBus specification.  Whenever a given signal
  matches one of the filters, the relevant callback function should be called.

  For KDBus this implies calculating and installing proper bloom filters.  For
  DBus classic this implies managing a set of appropriate filters with the DBus
  daemon as specified in the DBus specification.

  Note that certain filtering mechanisms which are possible with DBus classic
  are likely not possible with KDBus.

  Priority: Medium
  Complexity: C4

- Add builder APIs for appending fixed-size array data.  Currently arrays are
  built one element at a time which can get pretty expensive for large arrays.
  A function that appends multiple fixed elements at once to the gvariant and
  dbus1 builders is needed.


Kernel Crypto
=============

- Add support for getsockname (getname) in the Linux kernel for sockets of
  type AF_ALG.  Currently this is not implemented and the kernel returns
  EOPNOTSUPP.


Big endian support
==================

- Fix big endian support for D-Bus message handling. Following test cases
  fail at the moment:
